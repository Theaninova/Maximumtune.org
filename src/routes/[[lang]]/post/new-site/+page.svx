Hi there! It's Mythâœ°'s girlfriend here!

After an absolute eternity of time, we've decided to completely
rebuild the site from scratch. Ditching WordPress and going for
a fully custom solution.

This means better looks, a more responsive experience, and way
less headache for us.

Unfortunately, this big transition also means we have to manually
migrate all the posts, which for now means only a few of them
are available.

For those more interested in the technical details, we're using
[SvelteKit](https://https://svelte.dev/) and the static adapter
to build the site giving us an immensely more flexible and
performant solution. The site is now also using custom CSS only
with no pre-built themes, as well as using [`mdsvex`](https://mdsvex.com/)
to build the site's individual pages.

As a bonus,
the source code (minus posts and image resources) is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/Theaninova/mmtorg).
